/*
Requirements:
A basic arcade movement drive that can be switched to a tank controll function that can accomidate our
drivers needs as to increase ease of use with the drivers and therfor increase the score

the arcade movement takes one joystick inputs and sets the motor values, if it is within
a small range of tolerence it sets it definitively(To account for design inperfection in the controller
and for slight drifing due to imperfect joystick position) These "Tolerence ranges" are a range of 10 and
they are around the contolls of turning movement and directional movement

The tank movement takes two joystick inputs and uses their "Hights" as inputs to the movement motors



*/

/*
some drivers like tank based controll(Each joysticks outputs to the motor)
and arcade(Generic controll method one joystick controlls all movement),
this can be easily switched here as such to accomadate the drivers needs
