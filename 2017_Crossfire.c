/*
Requirements:
Robot must drive. Performed by drive function.
The driving function must provide both tank and arcade control. It does.
The robot must rescue Manny. Provided by the rescue function.
The robot must not move the rescue device past a certain limit. It meets this requirement.
The robot must shoot water. Provided by the shoot function.
The robot must sort the water into an ordered pattern. The robot does.

UI:
6U: lift manny rescue device
6D: put down manny rescue device
5U: Toggle shooter.

7L: toggle ball organizer.
7U: toggle arcade drive or tank drive.
