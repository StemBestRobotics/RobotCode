/*
Requirements:
A basic arcade movement drive that can be switched to a tank control function that can accommodate our driversâ?? needs as to increase ease of use with the drivers and therefore increase the score, through ease of driver use.

The arcade movement takes one joystick as input, or two channels, and sets the motor values if it is within a small range of tolerance it sets it definitively (To account for design imperfection in the controller and for slight drifting due to imperfect joystick position). These "Tolerance ranges" are a range of 30 and they are around the controls of turning movement and directional movement

The tank movement takes two joystick inputs and uses their "Heights" as inputs to the movement motors
