/*
Requirements:
A basic arcade movement drive that can be switched to a tank controll function that can accomidate our
drivers needs as to increase ease of use with the drivers and therfor increase the score

the arcade movement takes one joystick inputs and sets the motor values, if it is within
a small range of tolerence it sets it definitively(To account for design inperfection in the controller
and for slight drifing due to imperfect joystick position) These "Tolerence ranges" are a range of 90 and
they are around the contolls of turning movement and directional movement

The tank movement takes two joystick inputs and uses their "Hights" as inputs to the movement motors

There is also a gearshift that must half the speed of the motor when pressed. It would work as a toggle that could also
shift back, this is in place to allow drivers to have fast movement and fine tuned persision

the different movement options(2 joystick tank controll and 1 joystick arcade controll) must both be switched with
a toggle, akin to the gearshifts toggle, that can freely switch between the controll systems, making it easier on the drivers
thus makes the aplication of out scoring stratigies signifigantly easier

There must also be a servo which moves to max on a button, and moves to start on a different button to operate the shooting arm
In combonation there must be a motor that turns one way when a button is pressed, turn the other way when a different button is pressed, and turn of If
neither are pressed
