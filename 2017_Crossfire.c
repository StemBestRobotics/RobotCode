/*
Requirements:
A basic arcade movement drive that can be switched to a tank control function that can accomidate our
drivers needs as to increase ease of use with the drivers and therfore increase the score

The arcade movement takes one joystick input and sets the motor values based upon those inputs, if it is within
a small range of the tolerence it sets it definitively(To account for design inperfection in the controller
and for slight drifing due to imperfect joystick position). These "tolerence ranges" are a range of 10 and
they are around the contols of turning movement and directional movement

The tank movement takes two joystick inputs and uses their "Heights" as inputs to the movement motors

some drivers like tank based control(Each joysticks outputs to the motor)
while others like arcade(Generic control method one joystick controls all movement),
this can be easily switched here as such to accomadate the drivers needs
