/*
Requirements:
A basic arcade movement drive that can be switched to a tank control function that can accomidate our
drivers needs as to increase ease of use with the drivers and therefore increase the score, through
ease of driver use.

The arcade movement takes one joystick as input, or two channels, and sets the motor values if it is within
a small range of tolerence it sets it definitively (To account for design inperfection in the controller
and for slight drifing due to imperfect joystick position). These "Tolerence ranges" are a range of 30 and
they are around the contols of turning movement and directional movement

The tank movement takes two joystick inputs and uses their "Heights" as inputs to the movement motors

*/

some drivers like tank based control (Each joysticks outputs to the motor)
and some like arcade (Generic control method where one joystick controls all movement),
this can be easily switched here as such to accomadate the specific driver's needs
